Exercise 3:

Consider the palindromic numbers. A palindromic or symmetric number is a number that does not change when you write its digits in reverse order.

Some examples of palindromic numbers:
363
2882
29492

Implement a function that returns the number of all three-digit palindromic numbers.

Present the solution in the form of a function called calculate(). In response, call calculate() function and print the result to the console.
